Since its founding numerous projects have been planned and carried out in many countries around the world.[3] The company develops and produces all products at the headquarters in Budapest, Hungary. The company is privately owned by the founder Árpád Gergely Vida. To this day he is CEO and head of the development department.[4]\nHistory[edit]\nLightware was founded by Árpád Gergely Vida, Miklós Debreczeni, Attila Nagy and György Németh in 1998. In its early years, two employees worked for the company, and they repaired only projectors and plasma TVs.[5]\nIn 2006 the engineers of Lightware invented the EDID Manager as the very first product, helping the users to handle the different predefined video signal resolutions. After this, the company appeared at the ISE exhibition in Brussels, Belgium. A year later, the first hybrid eight-input and eight-output fully digital video-multiplexer matrix supporting HD resolution, the 32x32 DVI and HDMI Matrix Switcher was completed. This device eliminated the need for multiple devices by combining DVI and HDMI connectivity ports on a large crosspoint size.[6]\nIn 2011 Lightware opened its first two offices outside Hungary, in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America, two years later followed by the ones in Australia, Italy and Singapore,[7] and in 2015 in the Netherlands, India and in the Middle East.[8]\nIt was 2020, when Lightware announced the arrival of the Taurus UCX, using USB-C technology to send video, audio, control and Ethernet signals through a single cable for enhanced collaborations.[5]\nActivity[edit]\nLightware focuses on audiovisual technology, develops and manufactures data transmission devices. The products of the company are used in rental events, such as concerts and shows.[9][10]\nLightware is Europe's biggest AV manufacturer company. The product range includes AV-over-IP products, presentation switchers, HDMI switchers and extenders. The Taurus UCX range offers the latest technology for boardrooms incorporating USB-C, HID USB, room control and video distribution and switching with Cisco certified class leading technology.[11]\nHigh-tech meeting room systems that support hybrid work are also operated with the company's devices, for example at Google, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix or Facebook, where the entire control and automation of the meeting rooms, the power, turning on and off of the lighting can be solved from a single touch screen.[12] In addition, Lightware's products can be found in 3D simulation rooms of car factories, in the controls of oil platforms, in the control centers of well-known buildings, as well as on airplanes, yachts and submarines.\nThe company develops and manufactures all its products at its headquarters in Budapest. Since the company has offices and distribution points worldwide, more than 99% of sales revenue comes from export.[13]\nProduct lines[edit]\nTaurus UCX and TPX\nUBEX (Ultra Bandwidth Extender)\nVINX (Video Network Extender)\nTPX extenders\nMX2 series\nMX2M series\nMX series\nUSB-C cables\nMODEX\nEvent Manager\nLightware software\nTaurus UCX and TPX\nUBEX (Ultra Bandwidth Extender)\nVINX (Video Network Extender)\nTPX extenders\nMX2 series\nMX2M series\nMX series\nUSB-C cables\nMODEX\nEvent Manager\nLightware software\nSales network[edit]\nThe company has opened offices on four continents so far.
