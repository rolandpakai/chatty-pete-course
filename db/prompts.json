This extender pair is particularly recommended for rental and staging applications, 4K live events, and for future-proof operation centers. The extender can transmit HDMI 2.0 signals with 18Gbps over one multimode fiber to a distance of up to 700 meters. Video and Ethernet signals are transferred over a single optical line.,Using the factory, custom or transparent EDID emulation the user can fix and lock EDID data on the HDMI connector. Advanced EDID Management forces the required resolution from any video source and fixes the output format conforming to the system requirements. The unit offers bi-directional and transparent RS-232 transmission and two separate Gigabit Ethernet signals over the fiber connection.,All devices can be mounted on a rack shelf or used standalone, rack ears also serve easy handling and bump protection, mounting threads on top and one of the sides to conform strict installation safety regulations.,The device features Pixel Accurate Reclocking, a Lightware technology to eliminate jitter and skew generated by low quality sources and multiple daisychained devices. Single fiber technology makes these units fully HDMI compliant without need of a second fiber cable or copper connections.,Galvanic isolation between source and display helps avoiding ground loops and hum effects. No delay occurs in the signal during optical conversion, the video image is transported without frame latency. This feature is crucial in 3D applications and systems where audio is processed separately.,Lightware’s HDMI20-OPTC series supports both HDR and Dolby Vision in the HDMI signal at 10 or 12 bit speeds respectively, within its frame bandwidth of 18 Gbps maximum.,The Lightware OPTC extenders can also create a powerful combination with a wide-range of 3rd party video wall solutions, including Corvette, Megapixel HELIOS and Brompton.,Extension distance up to 700 meters (with OM3/OM4 fiber, 4096x2160p60),Built-in Event Manager control automation feature,Supports HDMI 4K signal formats (4K UHD @60Hz RGB 4:4:4, up to 18 Gbps),Supports HDMI 3D signal formats (frame packing, side-by-side and top-bottom),HDMI 2.0, HDMI 1.4 and DVI 1.0 compliant,HDCP 2.2 compliant (transparent pass-through),Bi-directional RS-232 extension (pass-through and control),No signal latency, zero frame delay,Single Fiber Technology,Dual output with built-in distribution amplifier,Uncompressed video up to 18 Gbps datarate (600 MHz pixel clock),4096x2160@60Hz/4:4:4 maximum resolution (600MHz),Firmware upgrade through Ethernet,Supports all embedded audio formats (including PCM, Dolby Digital and DTS high bitrate audio),Extension distance up to 2500 meters (with OM3 fiber, 1920x1080p60),Advanced EDID Management,Command injection on RS-232 and IR ports,Front panel LCD menu and buttons for crosspoint control,Multiple TCP/IP connections,Intuitive control software for device configuration,Device control via Ethernet (TCP/IP), RS-232 and USB,HDR and Low Latency Dolby Vision support,No video compression,Built-in universal power supply,Directly mountable in 19\" rack,Breakout LC connector for Neutrik OpticalCON Duo unused fiber channel,EtherCON ruggedized LAN connector,Active fan cooling,Front to back cooling airflow,Device,Optical Connectors,Power Inlet,Ethernet,HDMI Ports,Serial port,USB,HDMI20-OPTC-TX/RX220-Pro,1x Neutrik OpticalCON DUO,IEC 60320-C14,2x EtherCON for Gigabit Ethernet (control & pass-through),TX: 2x HDMI 2.0 input (18G) and 1x HDMI 2.0 output (18G),RX: 2x HDMI 2.0 output (18G) and 1x HDMI,2.0 output (9G),D-SUB 9 male (DE-9M) for RS-232 (control or pass-through),Mini USB B,HDMI20-OPTC-TX/RX220-NTQ,1x Neutrik OpticalCON Quad,HDMI20-OPTC-TX/RX220-FOX,1x Fiberfox,HDMI20-OPTC-TX/RX220-PCN,1x Neutrik OpticalCON DUO,Neutrik Powercon True1,Specifications,Max Video Data rate,18 Gbps,Max Resolution,Up to 4K UHD 3840×2160@60Hz,Video delay,0 frames,HDR Modes,HDR 10, HDR 12 and Dolby Vision,HDCP,HDCP 2.2 compliant,EDID emulation,Advanced EDID Management,EDID memory,Factory preset and user-programmable,EDID support,256 byte Extended EDID,Front panel control,Jog Dial and select button on TX  Select button on TX  Function button on RX,Visual feedback on TX and RX units,LCD menu for EDID setup and status check on TX.,TX status LEDS,POWER/LIVE  FIBER LINK  HDCP  INPUT 1  INPUT 2,RX status LEDs,POWER/LIVE  FIBER LINK  HDCP  SIGNAL PRESENT  OUTPUT CONVERSION,RS-232 pass through,Bi-directional 9.6, 14.4, 19.2, 38.4, 57.6 kBauds,Fiber,LC duplex, LC simplex for channel breakout,Laser wavelengths,6 channel CWDM,High speed lanes,778;
